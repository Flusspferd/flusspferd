Flusspferd: Javascript bindings for C++, a Javascript interpreter and shell, and a Javascript/C++ module system. Also, Flusspferd includes a few Javascript classes and modules: binary blobs, XML, cURL, SQLite 3 and others.

Flusspferd supports Spidermonkey as its backend, and possibly support for v8 or other engines will be added later.
