Flusspferd
==========

Javascript bindings for C++, a Javascript interpreter and shell, and a
Javascript/C++ module system. Also, Flusspferd includes a few Javascript classes
and modules: binary blobs, XML, cURL, SQLite 3 and others.

It supports Spidermonkey as its backend, and possibly support for other engines
will be added later.

Flusspferd is licensed under the MIT license (open source).

Building & installing Flusspferd
--------------------------------

You can build Flusspferd (thanks to our wrappers) with

$ ./configure && make && sudo make install

as you probably are accustomed to. You might have to pass some parameters to
./configure:

  -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost
  -DSPIDERMONKEY_ROOT=/path/to/spidermonkey

These parameters are passed directly to cmake, i.e. you can also pass other
parameters that cmake understands.

You can generate the documentation with

$ ./util/docs.sh

The generated documentation is in ./build/html/.

Using Flusspferd
----------------

We have tutorials at http://flusspferd.org/docs/tutorials.html. Just a quick
peek:

$ flusspferd
> "Hello!"
Hello!
> require('posix').sleep(5)

(The text after ">" in each line is input.)
