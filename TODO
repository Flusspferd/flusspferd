flusspferd TODO list:

- Revisit the C++ exception system, especially the throw exception("Foo") part.

- really make Importer secure (including maybe white/blacklisting of modules,
  and restricting search paths)

- Produce code coverage figures for JS (use JS debugger API to trace execution
  and work out at least which lines have or haven't been run)

- Add more exception classes that are instanceof Error, but still has a stack
  property.

- Let JS define new exception classes similar to above, but that also have
  lineNumber and fileName properties
