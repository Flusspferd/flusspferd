Release Notes
=============

0.8 Series
----------

0.8: Major release (git: v0.8)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:
- Refactor of require() handling -- this means modules are now JITable.
- Implement most of the CommonJS `fs-base' (Filesystem/A/0) module.
- Treat source files as UTF-8 -- this means you can have unicode literals in
  .js source files now.
- REPL now prints debug/uneval representation, rather than .toString().
- Enable Spidermonkey strict warnings for all modules.
- SQLite3 plugin got an overhaul.
- Immature plugins are no longer part of the main tree. This means no cURL,
  or XML plugins for now. If you want them, help us finish (designing) the API.
- JSON top-level-object is now always available.

0.7 Series
----------

0.7: Major release (git: v0.7)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:
- Changed Flusspferd module system C++ API.
- Dropped old proprietary 'blob' module in favor of 'binary' (conforming
  with CommonJS Binary/B).
- Add CommonJS 'system' module, moving some functionality from other modules
  to it.
- Replace option parsing with new 'getopt' module, which can also be used
  from Javascript.
- Add support for permanent history to the shell.
- Add optional support for GNU readline.

And other features and a lot of bug fixes.

0.6 Series
----------

0.6.1: Bugfix release (git: v0.6.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from some very minor tweaks, this release mainly brings the ability to
manually enable and disable plugins in the build system.

0.6: Major release (git: v0.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:

- FLUSSPFERD_CLASS_DESCRIPTION - an easy way of defining Javascript classes.
- Improved value and type conversions.
- More ServerJS compatible modules: 'binary' and 'encodings'.
- Changed build system to cmake (this should make it easier to get Windows
  support).
- Other new modules, like (rudimentary) GMP support.

This list is not necessarily a complete list of features.

Also, there are many more bugfixes and some API breaking changes.

0.5 Series
----------

0.5.1: Bugfix release (git: v0.5.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes since 0.5:

- Fix bug that made flusspferd not compile when spidermonkey was not compiled with JS_THREADSAFE.
- Change set of distributed files (include Makefile, don't include .configure).
- Documentation improvements.

0.5: First release (git: v0.5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is our first released version.

Notably, Flusspferd now supports SecurableModules.
