Release Notes
=============

0.6 Series
----------

0.6: Major release (git: v0.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:

- FLUSSPFERD_CLASS_DESCRIPTION - an easy way of defining Javascript classes.
- Improved value and type conversions.
- More ServerJS compatible modules: 'binary' and 'encodings'.
- Changed build system to cmake (this should make it easier to get Windows
  support).
- Other new modules, like (rudimentary) GMP support.

This list is not necessarily a complete list of features.

Also, there are many more bugfixes and some API breaking changes.
