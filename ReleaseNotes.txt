Release Notes
=============

0.7 Series
----------

0.7: Major release (git: v0.7)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:
- Changed Flusspferd module system C++ API.
- Dropped old proprietary 'blob' module in favor of 'binary' (conforming
  with CommonJS Binary/B).
- Add CommonJS 'system' module, moving some functionality from other modules
  to it.
- Replace option parsing with new 'getopt' module, which can also be used
  from Javascript.
- Add support for permanent history to the shell.
- Add optional support for GNU readline.

And other features and a lot of bug fixes.

0.6 Series
----------

0.6.1: Bugfix release (git: v0.6.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from some very minor tweaks, this release mainly brings the ability to
manually enable and disable plugins in the build system.

0.6: Major release (git: v0.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:

- FLUSSPFERD_CLASS_DESCRIPTION - an easy way of defining Javascript classes.
- Improved value and type conversions.
- More ServerJS compatible modules: 'binary' and 'encodings'.
- Changed build system to cmake (this should make it easier to get Windows
  support).
- Other new modules, like (rudimentary) GMP support.

This list is not necessarily a complete list of features.

Also, there are many more bugfixes and some API breaking changes.
