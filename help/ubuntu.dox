/**
 * @page ubuntu How to install Flusspferd on Ubuntu 8.10
 *
 * This document describes how to build Flusspferd on Ubuntu 8.10. But of course
 * most of this can be used on older Ubuntu versions or other Linux
 * distributions (especially Debian and other Debian clones).
 *
 * @section precond Preconditions
 * First of all we need to install the build tools and git
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core
@endverbatim
 * It's not necessary but to get a more comfortable REPL it's highly
 * recommended to install libedit
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libedit-dev
@endverbatim
 *
 * @section boost Building Boost
 * Unfortunately the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> packages that
 * come with Ubuntu are outdated and Flusspferd won't work with them. So we
 * need to compile our own version of Boost.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost_1_38_0.tar.bz2
$ tar xjf boost_1_38_0.tar.bz2
$ cd boost_1_38_0/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd ..
@endverbatim
 *
 * @section spidermonkey Building Spidermonkey
 * The Spidermonkey packages that come with Ubuntu are broken and Flusspferd
 * won't work with them. This might not be the fault of the Ubuntu maintainers
 * since building Spidermonkey is a bit messy due to the lack of a proper build
 * system. The situation is improving with Spidermonkey 1.8 but since 1.8 is
 * not finally released at the time and due to major changes (Tracemonkey) is
 * not that stable at the moment we will stick with Spidermonkey 1.7. If you
 * really need speed or want the newest stuff just checkout Spidermonkey 1.8
 * Flusspferd should work with it.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/js-1.7.0.tar.gz
$ tar xzf js-1.7.0.tar.gz
$ cd js/src/
$ make DEFINES=-DJS_C_STRINGS_ARE_UTF8 -f Makefile.ref
$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/js
$ sudo cp *.h *.tbl Linux_All_DBG.OBJ/*.h /usr/local/include/js/
$ sudo cp Linux_All_DBG.OBJ/libjs.* /usr/local/lib/
$ cd ../..
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection rmspidermonkey Removing Spidermonkey
 * Since Spidermonkey doesn't come with an install target we have to copy
 * the files per hand. If for some reason you want to remove spidermonkey
 * from your system again (note that Flusspferd depends on Spidermonkey during
 * the runtime), you have to remove it per hand, too.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/include/js/ /usr/local/lib/libjs.*
@endverbatim
 *
 * @section flusspferd Building Flusspferd
 * Finally we come to Flusspferd.
 * @verbatim
$ git clone git://github.com/ruediger/flusspferd.git
$ cd flusspferd/
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
$ ./configure --enable-tests
$ ./waf
$ make test
$ sudo make install
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection iosupport Building Flusspferd with IO support
 * Simply add @p --enable-io to the configure flags
 *
 * @subsection sqlite Building Flusspferd with SQLite support
 * You have to install SQLite's headers first
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
@endverbatim
 * and add @p --enable-sqlite to the configure flags
 *
 * @subsection xml Building Flusspferd with XML support
 * You have to install libxml2's headers first
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection curl Building Flusspferd with cURL support
 * You have to install cURL's headers first. Either choose
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
@endverbatim
 * or
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
@endverbatim
 * and add --enable-curl to configure flags
