/**
 * @page ubuntu How to install Flusspferd on Ubuntu 9.10
 *
 * This document describes how to build Flusspferd on Ubuntu 9.10. For older
 * versions, you might need to compile some prerequisites yourself.
 *
 * @section precond Preconditions
 *
 * First of all we need to install the build tools and Boost 1.40.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
$ sudo apt-get install libboost1.40-dev libboost-system1.40-dev libboost-thread1.40-dev libboost-filesystem1.40-dev libboost1.40-iostreams1.40-dev
@endverbatim
 *
 * It's not necessary but to get a more comfortable REPL/Shell it's highly
 * recommended to install libedit
 *
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libedit-dev   # optional but recommended
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you want to run Flusspferd's unit test system you also need the
 * Boost.Test Library
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-test1.40-dev   # optional
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you want to use the most current (but probably unstable) version of
 * Flusspferd you also need the git version control system
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install git-core   # optional
@endverbatim
 *
 * @section spidermonkey Building Spidermonkey
 *
 * Flusspferd requires Spidermonkey 1.8.1 or higher. (Flusspferd versions 0.8 and older
 * support Spidermonkey 1.7 and 1.8.0rc). Since at the time of
 * writing Spidermonkey 1.8.1 was not released. You either have
 * to build Spidermonkey tip (from the HG repository mozilla-central) or
 * you can fetch an inofficial snapshot from
 * http://flusspferd.org/vendor/spidermonkey-hg.tar.bz2 .
 *
 * <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation">
 * There is a detailed build documentation over at the Mozilla Developer
 * Center Wiki</a>.
 *
 * A quick installation guide.
 * @verbatim
$ wget http://flusspferd.org/vendor/spidermonkey-hg.tar.bz2
$ tar xjf http://flusspferd.org/vendor/spidermonkey-hg.tar.bz2
$ cd js/src
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
@endverbatim
 *
 * @section flusspferd Building Flusspferd
 *
 * If you have downloaded a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/flusspferd/files/">
 * release file</a>, you should unpack it.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can use git to check out the newest (but possibly
 * unstable) version of flusspferd:
 *
 * @verbatim
$ git clone git://github.com/ruediger/flusspferd.git
$ cd flusspferd/
@endverbatim
 *
 * Now we can build and install Flusspferd.
 *
 * @note Please note that plugins are by default automatically detected and you
 *       need to install @em all their dependencies @em first.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ ./configure -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF
$ make
$ sudo make install
@endverbatim
 *
 * You can pass -DLINE_EDITOR=readline to ./configure if you want Flusspferd
 * to use GNU/readline, which we don't use by default because it has a GPL
 * license.
 *
 * If you want to run the global version of Flusspferd you will also have to
 * tell the system where to find the library
 *
 * @verbatim
$ echo /usr/local/lib > local.conf
$ sudo mv local.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
$ sudo ldconfig
@endverbatim
 *
 * Finally you should properly set up the bash completion script which allows
 * intelligent tab completions in bash:
 *
 * @verbatim
$ sudo cp /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/flusspferd /etc/bash_completion.d
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection sqlite Building Flusspferd with SQLite support
 *
 * Support for SQLite is autodetected during configuration. To compile with
 * SQLite support you have to install the SQLite 3's dev-files
 *
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection gmp Building Flusspferd with GMP support
 * Support for GMP is enabled during configuration time when GMP's and GMPXX's
 * dev-files are found. You can install them with
 * @verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
@endverbatim
