/**
 * @page cpp-tutorial-firstprogram Your first Flusspferd program
 *
 * Previous: \ref cpp-tutorial
 *
 * Let's begin with a very simple program, a version of "Hello World".
 *
 * @include first_program.cpp
 *
 * @note You can find the source file listed above in
 *       <code>help/examples/first_program.cpp</code>.
 *
 * In order to use Flusspferd, we need to create a
 * @ref flusspferd::context "context" and make it the <em>current context</em>,
 * which flusspferd::current_context_scope does as long it is in scope. You can
 * use flusspferd::current_context_scope in multiple nested scopes.
 *
 * @section compiling Compiling Flusspferd in your project
 *
 * Now that you've got a (very) simple project that uses Flusspferd, its time
 * to compile it.
 *
 * We assume that you have already @ref install "installed" Flusspferd. To use 
 * it in your project, you can use pkg-config, like this:
 *
 * @verbatim
$ g++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs flusspferd) myfile.cpp
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you use a build system, you can use its pkg-config integration.
 *
 * Let's go with the simple method of shelling out to @c pkg-config for
 * now. We don't recommend that you use this method for any serious development,
 * but it has the advantage of being easy and quick.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ g++  $(pkg-config --cflags --libs flusspferd) -o first_program first_program.cpp >/dev/null
$ ./first_programm
Hello, Flusspferd!
$
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you see the output "Hello, Flusspferd!" and just get a shell back, then
 * everything worked. If either of the above commands produces any different
 * output, then something went wrong in the install proccess and most likely a
 * required file couldn't be found.
 *
 * Next: \ref cpp-tutorial-values_and_objects "Values and objects".

/**
 * @page cpp-tutorial-values_and_objects Values and objects
 *
 * Previous: \ref cpp-tutorial-firstprogram
 *
 * Let's have a bird's-eye-view look at the basic value types supported by
 * Flusspferd. We shall create a few values of different types to get the hang
 * of it and we will also assert some basic facts about the values.
 *
 * @include values1.cpp
 *
 * @note The flusspferd::local_root_scope ensures that none of these objects
 *       will be destroyed by the garbage collector prematurely. But more about
 *       that in a later section.
 *
 * @note You can find the source in <code>help/examples/values1.cpp</code>.
 *
 * @section simple_objects Dealing with simple objects
 *
 * Let us translate this simple Javascript code to a C++ equivalent:
 *
 * @include simple_objects.js
 *
 * Translated to C++:
 *
 * @include simple_objects.cpp
 *
 * @note You can find the programs in
 *       <code>help/examples/simple_objects.js</code> and
 *       <code>simple_objects.cpp</code>.
 *
 * @section properties Objects and properties
 *
 * The class flusspferd::object (together with the other classes in 
 * @ref property_types) provides many methods for creating, accessing,
 * querying and manipulating properties. We will briefly look at some of them
 * here.
 *
 * For example, you can easily create a non-enumerable, read-only property:
 *
 * @code
obj.define_property("prop", initial_value,
  flusspferd::object::dont_enumerate | flusspferd::object::read_only_property);
@endcode
 *
 * Or, a property with a custom getter and setter:
 *
 * @code
flusspferd::property_attributes attr;
attr.getter = getter_function;
attr.setter = setter_function;
obj.define_property("prop", initial_value, attr);
@endcode
 *
 * @note Both @p getter_function and @p setter_function have to be of type
 *       flusspferd::function, which you can create with one of
 *       @ref create "these functions".
 *
 * And, among many other things, you can delete properties altogether:
 *
 * @code
obj.delete_property("prop");
@endcode
 *
 * Next: \ref cpp-tutorial-gc

/**
 * @page cpp-tutorial-gc Garbage collection
 *
 * Previous: \ref cpp-tutorial-values_and_objects
 *
 * As you probably know, Javascript and its implementations rely on
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">
 * garbage collection</a>. You can call the garbage collector explicity,
 * like this:
 *
 * @code
 * flusspferd::gc();
 * @endcode
 *
 * But Flusspferd or, rather, the underlying Javascript engine, will call the
 * garbage collector itself from time to time. Therefore, you need to protect
 * your objects and non-immediate values (@c undefined, @c null, boolean
 * values and small integer values are immediate) from garbage collection. You
 * can do so either by making sure they are <b>reachable</b>, for example by
 * making them a member of another "rooted" object, for example the global 
 * object, or by explicitly protecting them by making them root values. There
 * is also a third more advanced possibility that we won't cover now (see
 * flusspferd::tracer and flusspferd::native_object_base::trace).
 *
 * The simplest way to create rooted values is by creating a
 * flusspferd::local_root_scope. While it is in scope, all newly created
 * objects and non-immediate values will be root values. They will cease to be
 * root values once the local_root_scope is no longer in scope.
 *
 * @code
flusspferd::object o1 = flusspferd::create<flusspferd::object>();

{
    flusspferd::local_root_scope scope;

    flusspferd::object o2 = flusspferd::create<flusspferd::object>();

    flusspferd::gc();

    // o1 is probably deleted now, o2 is still alive.
}

flusspferd::gc();

// Now, o2 is probably deleted, too.
@endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, you can create root values directly:
 *
 * @code
 * flusspferd::root_value v;
 * flusspferd::root_string s;
 * ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * Next: \ref cpp-tutorial-functions
 */

/**
 * @page cpp-tutorial-functions Binding C++ functions
 *
 * Previous: \ref cpp-tutorial-gc
 *
 * An important use of Flusspferd is binding C++ functions so that they are
 * accessible from Javascript, for obvious reasons. Flusspferd provides
 * convenient methods for doing so.
 *
 * @include functions1.cpp
 *
 * @note You can find the source in <code>help/examples/functions1.cpp</code>.
 *
 * As you can see in the above example, you just declare your C++ functions
 * with the type you want and Flusspferd will deal with converting the
 * arguments  automaitically from the underlying types for you. The same goes
 * for the return values from your functions. If you've ever dealt with the
 * Spidermonkey API directly you'll know how much of a time saver this
 * behaviour is. (And in case you are wondering, this is achieved through C++
 * templates and boost meta-programming. Scary, scary meta-programming.)
 *
 * If this type coercion behaviour is counter to what you need for a particular
 * case, then you can get the raw arguments that your function was called with
 * by defining your function as returning <code>void</code> and taking a single
 * flusspferd::call_context argument:
 *
 * @code
void my_function(call_context &x) {
    // Result of the function is the number of arguments that it was called with
    x.result = x.args.size();

    if (x.args.size() > 1) {
      // Print the first argument (if there is one) to stdout
      cout << x.arg[0] << endl;
    }
}
@endcode
 *
 * @see @ref create
 *
 * Next: \ref cpp-tutorial-classes
 *
 */

/**
 * @page cpp-tutorial-classes Creating a Javascript class
 *
 * Previous: \ref cpp-tutorial-functions
 *
 * Other than functions, users of Flusspferd will likely want to create classes.
 *
 * As a simple example, we have chosen a "set of strings".
 *
 * @note You can find the source in <code>help/examples/stringset.cpp</code>
 *
 * Let's begin the walk through. First, as always, the required headers.
 *
 * @dontinclude "stringset.cpp"
 *
 * @until <set>
 *
 * We use the macro #FLUSSPFERD_CLASS_DESCRIPTION for describing the class to
 * Flusspferd. It takes one unnamed parameter and multiple named parameters
 * (yes, that's possible in C++).
 *
 * The first (unnamed) parameter @c cpp_name indicates the name of the class in
 * the C++ source code.
 *
 * @note #FLUSSPFERD_CLASS_DESCRIPTION will create two classes: @c StringSet and
 *       @c StringSet_base.
 *
 * @skip FLUSSPFERD_CLASS_DESCRIPTION
 * @until StringSet
 *
 * The parameters @c full_name and @c constructor_name define the complete
 * identifier (system-unique!) of the class respectively the name of the
 * constructor inside the container passed to flusspferd::load_class.
 *
 * @skip full_name
 * @until constructor_name
 *
 * With @c methods, we can bind Javascript method names to C++ methods.
 *
 * @skip methods
 * @until {
 *
 * Here begins the class @c StringSet.
 *
 * @skip public
 * @until public
 *
 * Below is the constructor that will be called from Javascript. Note that
 * the first parameter has to be passed to flusspferd::native_object_base.
 *
 * @skip StringSet
 * @until {
 *
 * Let us notify the user that the constructor has been called successfully.
 *
 * @skipline cout
 *
 * Now, we add the constructor parameters to the @c StringSet. To do so we
 * convert the flusspferd::value parameters to std::string (via
 * flusspferd::string).
 *
 * @skip for
 * @until }
 *
 * That's the whole constructor.
 *
 * @skipline }
 *
 * A few <code>typedef</code>s for the data types we use internally:
 *
 * @skip public
 * @until iterator
 *
 * The first three methods should be pretty straight-forward:
 *
 * @skip dump
 * @until delete_
 * @until }
 *
 * The method @c to_array (or rather, @c toArray, as seen from Javascript)
 * creates an array and calls @c Array.prototype.push to add each element
 * from the @c StringSet.
 *
 * @skip to_array
 * @until return
 * @until }
 *
 * The finish the implementation of @c StringSet, we need a @c std::set to
 * store the elements in.
 *
 * @skip private
 * @until };
 *
 * The print function simply prints its parameter.
 *
 * @skip print
 * @until }
 *
 * In @c main, we first create a flusspferd::context and then load the @c print
 * function.
 *
 * @skip main
 * @until print
 *
 * Now (<i>*drumrolls*</i>), we load the class @c StringSet into Flusspferd.
 *
 * @skipline load_class
 *
 * And finally, we'll use @c StringSet from Javascript.
 *
 * @skip evaluate
 * @until }
 *
 * That's it.
 *
 * @note You can find the program in <code>help/examples/stringset.cpp</code>.
 *
 * The output should be:
 *
 * @verbatim
Creating StringSet
Dumping StringSet: a,b,c,d
As Array: ["c", "d"]
Destroying StringSet

 * there).
 *
 * @include "dummy_module.cpp"

 * @note You can find this module in
 *       <code>help/examples/dummy_module.cpp</code>.
 *
 * If you compile this module as a shared library with the name
 * libdummy_module.so or libmodule_dummy.dylib, you should be able to load it

 *
 * @verbatim
