 *
 * @section configuring Configuring Flusspferd in your project
 *
 * We assume that you have already @ref install "installed" Flusspferd. To use it in your
 * project, you can use pkg-config, like this:
 *
 * @verbatim
$ g++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs flusspferd) myfile.cpp
@endverbatim
 *
 * If you use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/waf">Waf</a>, you can use
 * Flusspferd by calling check_cfg on the configuration object:
 *
 * @verbatim
conf.check_cfg(
               package = 'flusspferd',
               uselib_store='FLUSSPFERD',
               args='--cflags --libs',
               mandatory=1)
@endverbatim
