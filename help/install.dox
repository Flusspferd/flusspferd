/**
 * @page install How to install Flusspferd
 *
 * @section Dependencies
 *
 * Before installing Flusspferd, you need to install its dependencies.
 *
 * @li Linux or Mac OS X (possibly other POSIX systems work too),
 * @li <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">cmake</a> 2.6 or higher,
 * @li <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> 1.40 or higher,
 * @li <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey">Spidermonkey</a> 
 *     1.8.1 or higher (NOT 1.8.0)
 * @li Depending on your platform, you need to install iconv.
 *
 * Recommended, but optional:
 *
 * @li <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/libedit/">libedit</a> (BSD libedit) can be used for the integrated Javascript shell,
 * @li @b or GNU/readline (attention, GPL!),
 * @li <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a> 2.6 or higher (for the XML plugin),
 * @li <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">cURL</a> (for the cURL plugin),
 * @li <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite 3</a> 3.4 or higher (for the SQLite3 plugin).
 *
 * To get direct access to the development repository, you also need <a href="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</a>.
 *
 * @section Download
 *
 * If you haven't done so already, get the newest version of Flusspferd with
 *
 * @verbatim
$ git clone git://github.com/ruediger/flusspferd.git
@endverbatim
 *
 * Alternatively, you can download a release from
 * <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=255938">
 * Sourceforge</a> or a snapshot from
 * <a href="http://github.com/ruediger/flusspferd">Github</a>.
 *
 * @section Build
 *
 * Make sure that you are in Flusspferd's directory.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ cd flusspferd
@endverbatim
 *
 * @verbatim
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
@endverbatim
 *
 * You can use @p -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/local (or with another path in place of
 * @p /opt/local) if you don't want to install Flusspferd in the default path
 * @p /usr/local.
 *
 * If you want to use GNU/readline (e.g. for working UTF-8 support), pass
 * @p -DLINE_EDITOR=readline but beware that GNU/readline is GPL licensed.
 *
 * If you have installed your dependencies in unusual paths, or your system
 * is unusual in another way, you might need to specify additional options.
 *
 * @section results Test the results
 *
 * If all went fine so far, we should test whether flusspferd works now.
 *
 * @verbatim
$ flusspferd
> print("Hello", "world!");
Hello world!
@endverbatim
 *
 * Feel free to play around with the Javascript shell.
 *
 * @section bash-completions Bash Completions
 *
 * Flusspferd provides a completion script for the bash shell. It is usually installed
 * into @p PREFIX/etc/bash_completion.d/flusspferd since on most systems those files are
 * not sourced you should either add the following line to your @p ~/.bashrc (replace @p PREFIX
 * with the prefix where Flusspferd was installed)
 *
 * @verbatim
. PREFIX/etc/bash_completion.d/flusspferd
@endverbatim
 *
 * or copy the file into a path which is already sourced, like @p /etc/bash_completion.d/ on
 * most modern Linux systems.
 *
 * @section emacs-install-link Flusspferd's Emacs Mode
 *
 * Flusspferd comes with an
 * <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> mode to call the
 * Flusspferd Shell and interactively send javascript code to the Shell similar
 * to emacs-lisp-mode or inferior python mode. See
 * @subpage emacs-install "How to install and setup Flusspferd's Emacs Mode"
 * for more information.
 *
 * @section notes Some notes
 *
 * You might have noticed that Flusspferd doesn't use autotools or Makefiles
 * (although we provide a compatibility layer for those who can't live without).
 * Flusspferd uses <a href="http://cmake.org/">CMake</a> as its build
 * system.
 *
 * @subsection ubu Install on Ubuntu 9.10
 *
 * There is a seperate page on @subpage ubuntu "how to build Flusspferd on Ubuntu 9.10" and similar distributions.
 *
 * @subsection ebuild Install on Gentoo
 *
 * On Gentoo, you can use our ebuilds, in the branch 'packages', directory
 * 'gentoo/' to compile and install Flusspferd.

 *
 * @subsection macports Install on Mac OS X via Macports
